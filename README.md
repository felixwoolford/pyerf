Python Embodied Robotics Framework

This is a generic framework that I use for my minimal simulations of embodied agents 

It provides (in skeletal form):
  *A framework for quickly setting up an enviroment and one or more agents, with options to run with real time animations or at full speed
  *an embedded cli for manipulating and analysing the agents in real time
  *A suite of visualization tools using vispy and matplotlib
  *A framework for easily tracking agent and environmental variables
  

I haven't time right now to make any sort of proper documentation for this but if you are interested in using this or copying out the more interesting parts like the asynchronous cli please let me know and I will be happy to assist!
